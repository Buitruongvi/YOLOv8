This project demonstrates the implementation of the YOLOv8 algorithm for detecting humans in an image. YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository: The source code for [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) is publicly available on GitHub.
`!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 weights: [YOLOv8 Weights](https://yolov8-weights-url)
5. Place the downloaded weights file in the `weights/` directory.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation, you can run the human detection script on your images. Here's an example command:
