# Human Detection with YOLOv8

This project demonstrates the implementation of the YOLOv8 algorithm for detecting humans in an image. YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-detection-yolov8.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 weights: [YOLOv8 Weights](https://yolov8-weights-url)
4. Place the downloaded weights file in the `weights/` directory.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation, you can run the human detection script on your images. Here's an example command:
