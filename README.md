This project demonstrates the implementation of the YOLOv8 algorithm for detecting humans in an image. YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository: The source code for [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) is publicly available on GitHub. 

`!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git`

2. Install the required requirement:
```python
%cd ultralytics
!pip install ultralytics
import ultralytics
ultralytics.checks()
```
3. Download the pre-trained YOLOv8s weights: [YOLOv8s]([https://yolov8-weights-url](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8s.pt))


## Usage

Once you have completed the installation, you can run the human detection script on your images. Here's an example command:
